# Source for my now defunct AI Dungeon Discord Bot

**Note:**
- The bot, in its current state, is broken.
- I will not provide any setup assistance and I will not fix any bugs.
- Feel free to fork this project, but make sure you follow the license (read more in `LICENSE`)
- I wrote this bot in about a day so don't expect quality code.

**Setup steps:**
1. Put the token in the data/token.txt file
2. Install all the requirements
3. Create a file called `config.py`, read config.example.py for more info
4. Start launch.py
